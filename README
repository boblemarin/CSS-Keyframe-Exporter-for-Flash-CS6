CSS Keyframes Animations Exporter for Flash Pro CS6

What ?

This JSFL script adds the ability to export your MovieClips as CSS keyframes animations from Flash Pro CS6, so that they can run without any javascript in the browser.
The result is a PNG sprite sheet and a CSS file featuring a class that you simply apply to an html element to see the result.


Installation

Download CSS.plugin.jsfl and place it in Common/Configuration/Sprite Sheet Plugins/ inside the Flash Pro installation folder.
You need to restart the application for the exporter to appear in the dialog.


Usage instructions

Right-clic the element in your library and select "Generate Spritesheet".
In the export dialog screen, be sure to select the appropriate data format.

Development status
The current version can only export ONE SINGLE SYMBOL at a time (don't select multiple MovieClips). I'm currently working on fixing that issue. 

Thank you for your attention.
